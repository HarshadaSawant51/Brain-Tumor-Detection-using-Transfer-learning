# Brain-Tumor-Detection-using-Transfer-learning
  We have developed Flask web application where we have integrated Brain tumor detection functionality. The main aim of project is to classify MRI brain images as abnormal or normal images and also highlight tumor area. In our proposed system we are using transform learning in which VGG16 is used as feature extractor and Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm is used for classification .we are highlighting tumor region using segmentation method.
